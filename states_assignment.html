  <h1>Anlaysis of States</h1>  
  <h2><a style="color: red;" href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html" target="_blank">Favorite Website</a> </h2>  
    <p> This website is very eye pleasing. The colors blend well with each other.The website loads quickly without any issue. The menu is quite simple and not confusing,but a little too boring to look at. Nothing's perfect. You can find what you want very easily. The website is suitable for mobile and larger screens. This is my favorite website because I like how easy it was to navigate.  </p> 
    
  <h3><a style="font-size: 20px;color: aqua" href="https://portal.arkansas.gov" target="_blank">That State</a></h3>  
     <p> This website uses nice visuals that are pleasing to the eye.The colors also don't overwhelm the user's eye. The website doesn't load slowly. The menu is slightly hard to navigate. There are too many links on the main page. The website works well with different screen sizes. </p>
     
   <h4><a  style="font-size: 20px;color:forestgreen" href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_blank">Red State </a></h4>  
     <p>This website look confusing. The colors are not eye pleasing.The websote loads somewhat quicky. The menu is not too hard to navigate but there are a lot things all at once. The use of visuals is low and it looks like design wasn't much of importance.The website goes work well with different screen sizes.</p>
     
    <h5><a  style="font-size: 20px;color:deeppink" href="https://portal.kansas.gov/" target="_blank">Blue State</a></h5> 
        <p> This website uses different visuals and designs that overwhelm the eye. The colors used don't go well. The menu is confusing and hard to understand. There are plenty of information that is not important and is just taking up space. The website works well with different screen sizes.   </p>
     
     <h6><a style="font-size: 20px;color:darkorange"  href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"> My Least favorite</a></h6>
     <p> This website looks awful to the eye. The color red overpowers every other detail. The menu is not that hard to navigate but I don't like the design of the pages. The website seems to work well with different screen sizes. There should have been more pictures or other graphics. </p>
