<h1><a style="font-size: 20px;color: forestgreen" href="https://gloutir.com/#plans" target="_blank" >Good Website</a></h1>       
<p> This website looks very very nice. It's probably one of the best websites I've seen. The way the circle in the middle rotates looks pleasing to the
eye.The colors they chose blend well together and give a calming mood. I also like the different types of fonts they used.The overall theme gave me a        
nice feeling. In my opinion, the code looks pretty organized. They used a lot of the div and section elements.The way that circle moves when we're        
scrolling is really cool, and also the overall layout looks good. The only thing I would have wanted to be diffent is maybe adding some more color that       
goes with the theme in the area that says 'The Plans.' They are using tables but they have one row and one column.The way they used rectangle shaped         
borders around the main point of the website makes it look put together. I also really like how the name 'Gloutir' moves when we hover over it. The        
navigation is done in an interesting way. The areas we want to know about are specified in the top left corner, and when we click on them, we are sent      
to that area on that page.They didn't make different websites for each navigation item.The content within the part stating 'View complete Portfolio' 
looks very very cool. All of the information is within a nice curved rectangle and at the top there are different examples of logos move and
slide to the left. I found that effect to be quite eye pleasing and also the images right under it also change by itself from time to time.</p>       
<h2><a style="font-size: 20px;color: mediumvioletred" href="https://www.delacalle.mx/collections/frontpage" target="_blank" >Good Website #2</a></h2>         
<p>This website is very heavy on vibrant colors and gives a fun vibe to the user. The colors blend accordingly to the theme.They use diffent colors at the same place but they managed to do it in a way that looks pleasing. Also putting a very blend color for the background allows the main content to draw more attention while not tiring the user's eyes too much.  At the very first moment you open the website, you immediately want to buy the products they are promoting.I also really like the images they used. The texts right below the first image that is moving to the left is a cool way to make the website more interesting, and I think allows the user to draw in more attention.They used tables that are 1 column and 2 rows to give flavor choices, and I think that is a very organized way show display. The code is not the most organized. It's not terrible, but not very fun to look at either. The code uses many div elements to put the content in a specific way. The layout looks pretty nice and uderstandable.Th navigation is easy to use, makes sense and focuses around the idea of simplicity. The most recognizable aspect of the website that sets apart itself from other is its advanced understanding of the imporatnce of visuals. </p>
<h3><a style="font-size: 20px;color: aqua" href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank" >Worst Website</a></h3> 
<p> This website is just openly looks terrible. There's so much going on and hard to undertand anything. The layout is nowhere near being organized. It uses a lot of color, but they don't belend well with each other at all and just look awful. The navigation is all over the place and hard to use or even understand what's going on. The background doesn't look appealing and honestly looks very silly.The code itself doesn't look too bad but not really clean either. The content is presented in a way that confuses the user. The website has most of the information in squares that have different colors. I think that many squares takes away from the niceness of how the website looks. Using that many colors that don't blend well with each other and not having a theme contributes to the reasons why the website is terrible. Also the layout is designed in a way where the information is always presented going down vertically (uses only a specific part of the page and ignores the rest). The use of margins and paddings was not something they took advantage of. The pages that you get when you click on different pages under 'Quick Link' show even worse versions of the homepage-backgroud overpowers most things and the layout is incredibly confusing.
